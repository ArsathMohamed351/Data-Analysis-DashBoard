## Project Process  

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Used sample sales dataset (Excel file) containing date, product, region, salesperson, revenue, profit, and quantity.  

2. **Data Cleaning (Excel)**  
   - Removed blanks and duplicates  
   - Formatted column headers  
   - Ensured correct data types (dates, numbers, text)  

3. **Data Import (Power BI)**  
   - Imported the cleaned Excel dataset into Power BI  

4. **Data Modeling**  
   - Created calculated columns (e.g., Profit Margin)  
   - Built relationships (if multiple tables were used)  

5. **Dashboard Development**  
   - Added KPI cards (Revenue, Profit, Quantity, Margin)  
   - Designed charts:  
     - Line chart → Revenue Trend Over Time  
     - Bar chart → Revenue by Region  
     - Horizontal bar chart → Top Products by Revenue  
     - Donut chart → Revenue by Category  
     - Bar chart → Revenue by Salesperson  

6. **Interactivity**  
   - Added slicers/filters for Date, Region, Product Category, and Salesperson  

7. **Insights & Reporting**  
   - Identified top regions and products  
   - Compared salespersons’ performance  
   - Highlighted profit margin trends

  ## Project Insights  

- The **North region** generated the highest revenue compared to other regions.  
- **Top 5 products** contributed to more than 50% of total revenue.  
- The **profit margin** averaged around 29%, showing healthy profitability.  
- A few products had **high sales but low profit margins**, indicating potential pricing issues.  
- **Salesperson performance** varied widely, with the top salesperson contributing a major share of total revenue.  
- The **revenue trend** shows clear seasonality, with peak sales in specific months.  

## Conclusion  

This dashboard provides a clear overview of sales performance, helping to:  
- Monitor revenue, profit, and margins in real-time  
- Identify top-performing regions, products, and salespersons  
- Detect underperforming areas that need improvement  
- Support **data-driven decision making** for business growth  

Overall, the project demonstrates how **Excel + Power BI** can be combined to transform raw sales data into actionable business insights.
